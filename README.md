PROJECT OVERVIEW

MindPatch is a user-centered digital detox and wellness planner designed for students and young adults experiencing screen fatigue, academic stress, and emotional burnout. The app promotes mindful technology use by combining mood tracking, screen-time awareness, AI-simulated detox planning, reflective journaling, and habit-building features.

This repository documents the entire process from conceptualization to deployment, including user research, ideation, interface design, AI logic simulation, usability testing, iteration, and the final functional prototype.

The objective of MindPatch is not to eliminate technology, but to help users develop a healthier and more balanced relationship with it through gentle nudges, emotional awareness, and positive reinforcement.

--------------------------------------------------

PROBLEM STATEMENT

In today’s hyperconnected world, students spend excessive time on digital devices, leading to reduced concentration, emotional exhaustion, and mental health challenges such as stress and burnout. Many existing wellness applications feel intrusive or overwhelming. There is a need for a calm, emotionally supportive, and ethically designed solution that encourages digital balance without guilt or pressure.

--------------------------------------------------

TARGET USERS

- School and college students  
- Young adults facing digital overload  
- Individuals seeking mindful and non-judgmental wellness support  

--------------------------------------------------

EMPATHY & USER RESEARCH

Research and peer observations revealed that:
- Users are aware of excessive screen time but struggle to regulate it
- Emotional states strongly influence digital consumption habits
- Users prefer soft reminders over strict restrictions
- Ethical gamification increases consistency and engagement

Empathy mapping helped identify emotional pain points such as stress, guilt, lack of motivation, digital fatigue, and burnout.

--------------------------------------------------

IDEATION & DESIGN THINKING

Creative thinking tools such as SCAMPER, Mind Mapping, and User Journey Mapping were used to generate and refine ideas. The design focused on:
- Emotional safety and trust
- Minimal cognitive load
- Clear cause-and-effect interactions
- Ethical and non-intrusive AI behavior

--------------------------------------------------

CORE FEATURES

1. Mood Logging  
Emoji-based mood tracking with optional reflection notes.

2. Screen-Time Input Dashboard  
Manual screen-time entry supported by visual indicators.

3. AI-Generated Detox Planner (Simulated)  
Personalized wellness suggestions based on mood and screen-time inputs.

4. Gratitude Journal  
A calm journaling space for daily reflection.

5. Habit Tracker with Rewards  
Streaks, progress bars, and badges to reinforce healthy routines.

--------------------------------------------------

AI LOGIC SIMULATION

MindPatch demonstrates AI-driven personalization using rule-based logic simulation.

Example rules:
- If mood is low and screen time is greater than 4 hours, suggest short digital breaks and calming activities.
- If mood is neutral and screen time is moderate, suggest balance-maintenance habits.
- If mood is positive and screen time is low, reinforce healthy routines.

The logic is transparently communicated to ensure ethical and explainable AI behavior.

UI / UX DESIGN PRINCIPLES

- Soft pastel color palette (lavender, light blue, off-white)  
- Rounded cards with gentle shadows  
- Minimalist and clutter-free layouts  
- Emotionally supportive and non-judgmental language  
- Large touch targets for accessibility  

--------------------------------------------------

USABILITY TESTING & ITERATION

The prototype was tested with 10+ users.

Feedback highlights:
- Navigation clarity improved by increasing CTA size
- AI logic clarity improved by adding contextual explanations

At least two refinements were implemented based on user feedback.
